# Raspberry Pi IoT Journey

A repository where I teach myself IoT technology based on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The repository contains resources, tutorials and projects I have acquired developed along the way.

This repository should be treated as a way to showcase projects as well as serve as a 'how to'  that guides people to replicate said projects, not to be confused as an educative authority on the subject matter.  

Â¡Vamonos! Let's go!

### Getting Started <a name="getting-started"> </a>
My current setup involves interacting with the pi using the General Purpose Input/Output pins (GPIO) pins connected to components which are driven by Python programming logic.

To interact with the pi, I used headless 32-Bit Raspberry OS lite install running VS-Code Server over SSH (on the same LAN connection) to program and interact with the system. (Details to achieve this is in the **[software setup](#software-setup)** section).  

The hardware component setup will be in the form of simulated diagrams.

### Hardware Setup<a name="hardware-setup"> </a>
The basic hardware to use for the basic segment of this repository:
###### Basic Parts list
  1. Raspberry PI 4 model b
  1. SD Card (32Gb minimum) 
  1. **5V** Power Source (wall/ stored power)  
  1. Bread Board(s)
  1. LEDs(s)
  1. Resistors(s)
  1. Connectors(MM, MF, FF)
  1. Push Button(s)
  1. Capacitor(s)
  1. Motors(s)
  1. Dot matrix display(s)
  1. Digital Display(s)
  1. LCD display(s)


### Software Setup<a name="software-setup"> </a>

#### Raspberry OS setup
Setting up the headless 32-bit Raspberry OS lite.
  **Steps**
  - Install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) [Link to the official site]

    **Windows systems**

      Install the setup from the link above

    For Linux systems

    Debian

      ```$ sudo apt install rpi-imager```

    Fedora

      ```$ sudo dnf install rpi-imager```

  - Plug in your SD card to your pc
  - Run the Raspberry Pi Imager 
      Be sure to run the program on sudo mode or as administrator to enable write operations to disks (in this case, the SD card)

    **Windows systems**

     Run the Raspberry Pi Imager as Administrator 
For Linux systems
      ```$ sudo rpi-imager```

  - Select the 32-bit image and the relevant SD card

    [Selecting](.assets/src/videos/select%20image%20and%20sd%20card.mkv)
  - Setup the configuration for the device

  </p>

  - SSH into the Pi

      Aquire your Pi's local IP address from your router and use it to SSH into the board.

      ```$ ssh [YOUR USER NAME]@[YOUR HOST NAME/ Local IP]```

      Update the firmware before proceeding

      ```$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade```
      
  - Setup VS Code server

    - On your PC's VS Code, install the extention below
    [remote-ssh (marketplace link)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)

   <p align="center">
   <img alt="Extension" src=".assets/src/pics/remote%20server%20.png" height="" width="300px"/>
   </p>

  - Add a remote host

 <p align="center">
   <img alt="Extension" src=".assets/src/pics/adding_remote.png" height="" width="300px"/>
   </p>

  - Enter the SSH information

 <p align="center">
   <img alt="Extension" src=".assets/src/pics/pi_ssh_syntax.png" height="" width="400px"/>
   </p>

  - VS Code will setup the remote server

   With the hardware and software setup, you can proceed to the basics section

### Basics<a name="Basics"> </a>

  1. [Lighting an LED](.assets/md%20files/lighting_LED.md)

     A hello world of sorts. [link](.assets/md%20files/lighting_LED.md)
  1. [[Blinking an LED]]()

      An improvement of the above that uses python logic to blink the led indefinately or for a set number of times. [link]()
